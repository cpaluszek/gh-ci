# gh-actions

A terminal UI application for monitoring your GitHub Actions workflows and runs.

## Features

- üîç Browse your GitHub repositories with Actions workflows
- üìä View workflows and their recent runs
- üîÑ Monitor run status in real-time with visual indicators (WIP)
- üëÅÔ∏è See job status and details for each workflow run (WIP)

## Requirements

### Fonts
Pipeye uses Nerd Font icons for workflow and job status indicators. For the best experience:

1. Install a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) compatible font of your choice
2. Configure your terminal to use the installed Nerd Font

Without a Nerd Font, the status icons will appear as placeholder characters or missing glyphs.

## Installation

1. Install the `gh` CLI - [instructions](https://github.com/cli/cli?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

```bash
gh extension install gh-actions
